# Classic Set Game

Welcome to the Classic Set Game! This is a web-based version of the popular card game "Set," where the objective is to find sets of 3 cards that satisfy specific conditions based on four properties: **color, number, shape,** and **shading**.

## Game Description

In this game, you will be presented with a grid of cards. Each card has a unique combination of the following four properties:

- **Color**: The card can be one of several colors (e.g., red, green, blue).
- **Number**: The card can have 1, 2, or 3 symbols.
- **Shape**: The symbols on the card can be of different shapes (e.g., oval, squiggle, diamond).
- **Shading**: The symbols can be solid, striped, or open (outlined).

### How to Play

1. **Objective**: Find a "Set" of 3 cards where each property is either the same on all three cards or different on all three cards.
   
2. **Selecting Cards**: Click on the cards you believe form a Set. If the selected cards make a valid Set, they will be removed from the grid, and new cards will be dealt. If not, try again!

3. **Shuffle Button**: If you're stuck or want a fresh arrangement of cards, you can click the **Shuffle** button. This will shuffle the cards on the stage while leaving any currently selected cards untouched.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the game layout and content.
- **CSS**: Applied for styling the cards, grid, and overall game interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, including Set validation, card selection, and shuffling functionality.

### Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the `sets.html` file in your web browser. No additional setup is required.

### Future Enhancements

Possible improvements and features to be added in future updates:

- **Timer and Scoreboard**: Add a timer to track how long it takes to find all sets and a scoreboard to keep track of scores.
- **Hint Button**: Provide hints for finding the next possible Set.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Implement a mode where multiple players can compete to find Sets.
